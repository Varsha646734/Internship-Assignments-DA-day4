# SQL for Data Analysis - Task 4

## Objective
Use SQL queries to extract and analyze data from an **Ecommerce database**.

## Dataset
Sample tables used:
- **Customers (customer_id, name, city)**
- **Orders (order_id, customer_id, product_id, order_date, total_amount)**
- **Products (product_id, product_name, price)**

## Queries Implemented
1. Select with `WHERE`
2. Sorting with `ORDER BY`
3. Aggregations with `SUM`, `AVG`
4. `GROUP BY` with `HAVING`
5. Subqueries
6. Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)
7. Creating a `VIEW`

## Key Concepts
- Filtering data
- Aggregating results
- Joining multiple tables
- Using subqueries
- Creating views for analysis

## Tools
- MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite
- SQL Client (DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, or SQLite CLI)

## Deliverables
- `task4.sql` file with all queries
- Screenshots of query results (to be added by user)

## Outcome
Learned to manipulate and query structured data using SQL effectively.
